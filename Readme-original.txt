The accompanying files are distributed by the Center for Computer
Analysis of Texts (CCAT) at the University of Pennsylvania for the use
of students, teachers and scholars in study and education contexts.
They are not to be used, either directly or indirectly, for commercial
purposes without prior written consent of the various legal authors
and developers identified below. If copies are made and given to other
persons for NON-COMMERCIAL use, those persons are also required to
register with CCAT by completing the standard "User Declaration"
(included as a separate file on the diskettes) and returning it to
CCAT at the address indicated above. This is for legal and
collaborative purposes only; no fees are involved. The CCAT repository
contains a wide variety of materials obtained from various sources.
The following are standard items for which requests are regularly
received. It is expected that, in accord with normal scholarly
etiquette, use of such materials in publications, etc., will be
acknowledged appropriately.


BHS = Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia, ed. K. Elliger and W. 
Rudolph (Stuttgart: Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, 1967/77). 
Copyright held by the German Bible Society, in cooperation with 
the United Bible Societies (UBS). 

Michigan-Claremont BHS = The computer text produced initially 
under the direction of H. Van Dyke Parunak (then at Univ. 
Michigan) and Richard E. Whitaker (representing the Claremont 
Grad. Schools), with funding from the David and Lucile Packard 
Foundation. Subsequent revisions and verification have been 
coordinated by Whitaker with input from a variety of sources and 
special support from the CATSS (Computer Assisted Tools for 
Septuagint Studies) Project and its teams at the Hebrew 
University (Jerusalem; under E. Tov) and at the Westminster 
Theological Seminary (Elkins Park, PA; under A. Groves) as well 
as at the University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia). An early 
form of the Michigan-Claremont text provided the basis for the 
MIKRAH version, which in turn was further improved through 
cooperation with the Bar Ilan (Israel) computer center and the 
Maredsous (Belgium) based Centre: Informatique et Bible (CIB) 
directed by R. F. Poswick. The Michigan-Claremont text also has 
been collated against the CIB text.  The latest revision (done at 
Westminster Seminary in July of 1987) corrected the text according  
to facsimiles of Codex Leningradensis. 

LXX = Septuaginta, ed. A. Rahlfs (Stuttgart: WŸrttembergische 
Bibelanstalt, 1935; repr. in 9th ed., 1971). 

VULG = Biblia Sacra Vulgata, ed. R. Weber and B. Fischer. (Stuttgart:  
Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, 1963; 4th ed., 1983). 

CATSS LXX = The computer form prepared by the TLG (Thesaurus 
Linguae Graecae) Project directed by T. Brunner at the University 
of California, Irvine, with further verification and adaptation 
(in process) by CATSS towards conformity with the individual 
Gšttingen editions that have appeared since 1935. 

GNT = The Greek New Testament, 3nd corrected ed., ed. K. Aland,  
M. Black, C. M. Martini, B. M. Metzger, and A. Wikgren (Stuttgart: 
WŸrttemberg Bible Society, 1983). Copyright is held by the 
United Bible Societies (UBS).  

PAR = Parallel Hebrew-Aramaic and Greek texts of Jewish 
Scripture, based on the Michigan-Claremont BHS consonantal text 
and the TLG LXX, created by the CATSS project under the direction 
of E. Tov (Jerusalem team). This data base currently is in a  
provisional form that will undergo continued modification as the  
CATSS project proceeds to its goals. Portions of PAR can be  
supplied by special arrangement.   

LXXM = The morphologically analyzed text of CATSS LXX prepared by CATSS
under the direction of R. Kraft (Philadelphia team). 

BHSM = The morphologically analyzed Michigan-Claremont BHS materials. 

LXXV = The CATSS LXX plus the textual variants as encoded from the
apparatuses of the best available editions (especially Gošttingen,
Cambridge), and reformatted for computer by the Philadelphia team of CATSS
under the direction of R. Kraft. Only small portions of this data base are
currently available, and they are available on line.
