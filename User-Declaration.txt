texts or bodies of material as stipulated in the aforementioned documentation; 

(3) To control access to these materials and require any other party to whom the 
recipient supplies any portion of this material to observe these conditions and 
to register a signed USER AGREEMENT form with CCAT; 

(4) When making formal public reference to the materials, to acknowledge 
appropriately the holder of the copyright to any published text that has been 
encoded as well as to the encoder and the source from which the machine-readable 
form has been obtained, to the extent that these details are supplied in the 
aforementioned documentation. Unless otherwise noted, CCAT is the legal owner of
